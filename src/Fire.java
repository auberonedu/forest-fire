    /**
     * Returns how long it takes for all vulnerable trees to be set on fire if a
     * match is lit at a given location.
     * 
     * The forest is represented via a rectangular 2d char array where t represents a tree
     * and . represents an empty space.
     * 
     * At time 0, the tree at location [matchR, matchC] is set on fire. At every subsequent
     * time step, any tree that is adjacent (up/down/left/right) to a burning tree is also
     * set on fire. 
     * 
     * 
     * EXAMPLE 
     * forest:
     * 
     * t..tttt.t
     * ..tt....t
     * ..ttttttt
     * tttt.....
     * 
     * matchR: 2
     * matchC: 6
     * 
     * Result: 8
     * 
     * Explanation:
     * At time 0, the tree at (2, 6) is set on fire. At time 1, its adjacent trees also catch on fire
     * At time 2, the trees adjacent to those catch as well. At time 8, the last tree to catch is at
     * (0,6). In this example, there is one tree that never burns, so it is not included in the time calculation.
     * 
     * 
     * @param forest a 2d array where t represents a tree and . represents the ground
     * @param matchR The row the match is lit at
     * @param matchC The column the match is lit at
     * @return the time at which the final tree to be incinerated starts burning
